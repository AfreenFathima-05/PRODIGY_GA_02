Image Generation with Pre-trained Models:

This project demonstrates image generation from text prompts using pre-trained generative AI models.  
The implementation shows how textual input can be converted into visual output using existing image generation models.


Task Description:

The objective of this task is to utilize pre-trained image generation models such as DALL·E Mini or Stable Diffusion to create images based on user-provided text prompts.


What Was Done:

Selected a pre-trained image generation model
Provided text prompts as input
Generated images based on the given prompts
Displayed and verified the generated outputs


Technologies Used:

Python
Pre-trained Image Generation Models
Generative AI

Output:

The model successfully generates images that visually represent the given text prompts, demonstrating the effectiveness of pre-trained generative models for image synthesis.
